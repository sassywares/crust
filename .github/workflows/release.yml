# This workflow will run tests using node and then publish a package to GitHub Packages when a release is created
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-nodejs-packages

# In order to use this workflow, use the `npm run release:version` command to version your package and create a git tag.
# The workflow then runs whenever a new git tag is pushed to the repository and creates a release as well as publishes it to NPM.

# If you do not wish to use GitHub actions, use the `npm run release` command to create a new release locally as well as publish it to npm.
# In this case, you can remove the entire `jobs` section below or disable the workflow in the GitHub Actions UI.
