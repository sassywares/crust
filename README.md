# Crust 🍞

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40sassywares%2Fcrust.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40sassywares%2Fcrust) ![Builds](https://github.com/sassywares/crust/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)

Crust 🍞 is a simple boilerplate for creating and publishing packages to NPM. It includes a basic configuration for TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, and Changesets as well as a simple list of scripts for building, linting, testing and publishing your package.

## Features

- TypeScript
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Vitest
- Changesets
- NPM Scripts

## Getting Started

To get started with Crust 🍞, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Crust repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sassywares/crust.git
```

2. Alternatively, you can use the GitHub template feature to create a new repository from the Crust template.
3. Review the `package.json` file and make any necessary changes to the package name, version, description, and the additional information, leave the scripts for now.
4. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Scripts

Crust 🍞 includes a number of scripts for building, linting, testing, and publishing your package. The scripts are as follows:

- `lint` - Runs ESLint to lint the code.
- `lint:fix`: Runs ESLint with the `--fix` flag to automatically fix any linting errors.
- `test` - Runs Vitest to run the tests once.
- `test:watch` - Runs Vitest in watch mode.
- `format` - Runs `lint:fix` and Prettier to format the code.
- `dev` - Runs TypeScript in watch mode to build the code.
- `build` - Runs TypeScript to build the code, the output is placed in the `dist` directory. You can change the output directory by modifying the `outDir` property in the `tsconfig.json` file.
- `commit` - Adds all files to staging and commits them with a message, see .scripts/commit.sh for more information and to modify the commit message. This is intended to be used with the CI workflow, for normal commits use `git commit` normally.
- `push` - Pushes the current branch as well as the tags to the remote repository.
- `release.prepare` - Tests and builds the code for release.
- `release.publish` - Publishes the package to NPM.
- `release.version` - Creates a changelog using changeset, bumps the version, creates a git tag, commits the changelog, version, and tag as well as pushes them to remote.
- `release` - Runs `release.prepare`, `release.version`, and `release.publish` in sequence. Use this script to publish a new version of the package to NPM locally.
- `release.dry` - Runs `release` in dry mode, this will not publish the package to NPM.
- `clean` - Removes all generated files and directories as well as clears the NPM cache.

## Publishing

Crust 🍞 comes jam-packed with two ways to publish your package to NPM.

1. The first way is to use the `release` script. This script will run the `release.prepare`, `release.version`, and `release.publish` scripts in sequence. This script is intended to be used locally to publish a new version of the package to NPM.

2. The second way is to use the [GitHub Actions workflow](./.github/workflows/release.yml) included with Crust. This workflow will not version your package and runs only when you push a new tag to the main repo. You can modify this behavior by editing the `release.yml` file. To get started:
    - run `npm run release:version` on your terminal, this will create a new version and a new tag of the package and push it to the remote repository. The workflow monitors for new tags and will run when a new tag is pushed to the remote repository.
    - The workflow first creates a release for the tag on GitHub.
    - The workflow then runs the `release.prepare` and `release.publish` scripts in sequence, publishing the package to NPM.
    - Note the env variables in the workflow file, depending on your setup you may need to modify these variables.
    - `GITHUB_TOKEN` - This is the default GitHub token, this is automatically generated by GitHub Actions and is used to create the release on GitHub.
    - `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` - This is the NPM token used to publish the package to NPM, you only need this if you've enabled publishing with access tokens. Read more about this [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-access-tokens). Once you have the token in NPM, you'll have to add it as a secret in the GitHub repository. Read more about GitHub secrets [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets).
